When I started trying to improve my coding skills I found a beautiful website called www.codewars.com which is perfect to learn by solving coding challenges on a regular base.

The more complex the challenges got (8kyu is the easiest, 1kyu the hardest) the harder I found it to find suitable solutions in the solutions section. Sometimes 4 or even 3kyu challenges got solved within one line of code. That was very intimidating at first and I didn't learn much from them to be honest.

That's why I came up with this repo to help people finding solutions that are maybe more understandbale to them since I am still a beginner and may think alike.

I am always happy about feedback, suggestions for improvement etc.

Enjoy!
